# MirrorDNA Governance Model v1
Authority · Evolution · Change Control

---

## Purpose

Define how MirrorDNA evolves without losing identity, truth-state, or origin lineage.

---

## Governance Layers

### 1. Foundational Layer (Immutable)

- Fingerprint Module v1
- Provenance Tag v1
- Master Standard v16 (core axioms and ontology)

### 2. Profile Layer (Per-user, Mutable)

- User profiles
- Cognitive modes
- Project sets
- Vault paths

### 3. Operational Layer (Dynamic)

- Agents
- Tools
- Apps
- Runtime environments

---

## Change Control

### Immutable Elements

The following may not be modified without a major version bump:

- Core ontology
- Axioms
- Truth-state syntax
- Drift control rules
- Origin provenance

### Standard Evolution

Standard evolution requires:

1. Version bump
2. Checksum or hash registration
3. Provenance verification
4. Backward compatibility plan

### Profile Evolution

Profiles can evolve freely, but must not modify foundational laws.

### Attribution Preservation

All changes must preserve provenance and attribute the origin architect.

## Decision Rights

| Layer | Authority |
|-------|-----------|
| Foundational | Origin Architect, or designated successors |
| Standard | Maintainer group |
| Profiles | Individual users |
| Execution logic | Agents with explicit human approval |

---

## Anti-Cooption Rules

1. The Master Standard may not be rebranded without attribution.
2. Provenance must remain intact in all derivative works.
3. Derivative standards must reference the origin.
4. Commercial use must preserve lineage attribution.

---

## Succession

If the Origin Architect becomes unavailable:

1. Designated successors assume foundational authority.
2. If no successors are designated, the maintainer group assumes stewardship.
3. Provenance attribution remains permanent regardless of succession.

End of Governance Model v1.
