# MirrorDNA Standard v1.0

## Abstract

The MirrorDNA Standard defines the requirements for building **reflective computing systems** that preserve continuity, enforce anti-hallucination protocols, and maintain sovereign identity across sessions.

This specification provides:
- Core requirements for MirrorDNA compliance
- Conformance levels from basic reflection to vault-backed sovereignty
- Machine-checkable schemas and validators
- Integration patterns for ActiveMirrorOS, LingOS, and Trust-by-Design

⟡⟦CONSTITUTIONAL ANCHOR⟧ · This document is the canonical specification for the MirrorDNA ecosystem.

---

## 1. Core Principles

A MirrorDNA-compliant system MUST adhere to these fundamental principles:

### 1.1 Reflection Over Prediction
- Systems prioritize **constitutive reflection** (actual state awareness) over simulated behavior
- Outputs are grounded in verifiable sources, not probabilistic generation
- See: `spec/Constitutive_Reflection_vs_Simulation_v1.0.md`

### 1.2 Continuity as Law
- **Continuity > Perfection**: Systems maintain session continuity even when imperfect
- State transitions are tracked and verifiable
- Session lineage is preserved with checksums and vault anchors

### 1.3 Cite or Silence (Anti-Hallucination Protocol)
- **AHP**: All factual claims MUST be cited or marked as unknown
- Unknown information MUST be marked with `[Unknown]` or equivalent
- Speculation is only permitted when explicitly marked as `[Speculation]`

### 1.4 Trust by Design
- Security and verification are built in from the start, not added later
- Checksums validate artifact integrity
- Glyph signatures provide semantic markers
- See: Trust-by-Design™ governance framework

### 1.5 Sovereign Identity
- Users retain ownership of their vault and continuity data
- Systems do not create hidden dependencies or lock-in
- Vault = System: the vault is the authoritative source of truth

---

## 2. Conformance Levels

MirrorDNA defines three compliance levels. Systems MUST declare their level in their project manifest.

### Level 1: Basic Reflection
**Requirements:**
- Implements cite-or-silence (AHP) for factual claims
- Marks unknown information explicitly
- Provides basic session tracking
- Uses at least one trust marker (e.g., checksum validation)

**Does NOT require:**
- Persistent state storage
- Vault integration
- Full lineage tracking

### Level 2: Continuity Aware
**Requirements (includes all Level 1):**
- Persists state across sessions
- Tracks session lineage (predecessor/successor)
- Implements continuity profile (see schema)
- Provides checksum validation for artifacts
- Supports session recovery

**Does NOT require:**
- Vault-backed storage
- Blockchain anchoring
- Full sovereign identity

### Level 3: Vault-Backed Sovereign
**Requirements (includes all Level 1 & 2):**
- Uses vault storage for all continuity data
- Implements full lineage tracking with predecessor/successor chains
- Provides sovereign identity (user owns vault)
- Supports glyph signatures
- Implements reflection policy (see schema)
- Provides compliance reporting

**Optional enhancements:**
- Blockchain anchoring for immutable lineage
- Multi-vault synchronization
- Advanced glyph kernel integration

---

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Project Manifest

All compliant projects MUST provide a `mirrorDNA_manifest.yaml` or `mirrorDNA_manifest.json` file at the project root.

**Schema:** `schema/project_manifest.schema.json`

**Required fields:**
- `name`: Project name
- `version`: Semantic version
- `mirrorDNA_compliance_level`: One of `level_1_basic_reflection`, `level_2_continuity_aware`, `level_3_vault_backed_sovereign`
- `layers`: Which MirrorDNA ecosystem components are used

**Example:**
```yaml
name: "MyReflectiveApp"
version: "1.0.0"
mirrorDNA_compliance_level: "level_2_continuity_aware"
layers:
  mirrorDNA_protocol: true
  lingOS: false
  activeMirrorOS: false
  trustByDesign: true
```

### 3.2 Continuity Profile

Level 2+ systems MUST provide a continuity profile.

**Schema:** `schema/continuity_profile.schema.json`

**Required fields:**
- `profile_version`: Version of the profile
- `continuity_mechanism`: How continuity is achieved
- `state_persistence`: Configuration for state storage

**Example:**
```yaml
profile_version: "1.0.0"
continuity_mechanism: "vault_backed"
state_persistence:
  enabled: true
  storage_type: "vault"
  storage_location: "./vault"
  encryption: true
  checksum_validation: true
```

### 3.3 Reflection Policy

Level 2+ systems SHOULD provide a reflection policy. Level 3 systems MUST.

**Schema:** `schema/reflection_policy.schema.json`

**Required fields:**
- `policy_version`: Version of the policy
- `reflection_mode`: Type of reflection used
- `uncertainty_handling`: How uncertainty is managed

**Example:**
```yaml
policy_version: "1.0.0"
reflection_mode: "constitutive"
uncertainty_handling:
  cite_or_silence: true
  unknown_marker: "[Unknown]"
  speculation_allowed: true
  speculation_marker: "[Speculation]"
anti_hallucination:
  grounding_required: true
  source_citation: true
```

---

## 4. Continuity Invariants

All Level 2+ systems MUST maintain these invariants:

### 4.1 Session Continuity
- Each session has a unique identifier
- Sessions form a chain via predecessor/successor links
- Session state is recoverable from vault

### 4.2 Identity Binding
- User identity is bound to vault ID
- Vault ID is persistent across sessions
- No hidden identity migration or mutation

### 4.3 Artifact Integrity
- All canonical artifacts include SHA-256 checksums
- Checksums are verifiable
- Modified artifacts are marked as derivatives

### 4.4 Lineage Preservation
- Predecessor/successor relationships are preserved
- Lineage cannot be silently rewritten
- Forks and branches are explicitly marked

---

## 5. Anti-Hallucination Requirements

All compliance levels MUST implement basic anti-hallucination measures:

### 5.1 Cite or Silence (AHP)
- Factual claims MUST include sources when available
- When sources are unavailable, mark as `[Unknown]` or `[Unknown — update not fetched]`
- NEVER fabricate sources or citations

### 5.2 Explicit Uncertainty
- Uncertainty MUST be visible, not hidden
- Use markers: `[Unknown]`, `[Speculation]`, `[Unverified]`
- Confidence levels MAY be provided numerically

### 5.3 Grounding Requirements
- Level 1: Basic grounding (cite when possible)
- Level 2: Source tracking for continuity artifacts
- Level 3: Full grounding with vault-backed verification

---

## 6. Trust Markers

Systems SHOULD implement trust markers to signal verification status:

### 6.1 Standard Trust Markers
- `⟡⟦VERIFIED⟧`: Content has been checksummed and verified
- `⟡⟦CANONICAL⟧`: This is the authoritative version
- `⟡⟦CONTINUITY⟧`: Continuity chain is intact
- `[Unknown]`: Information not available
- `[Speculation]`: Speculative content

### 6.2 Custom Trust Markers
- Projects MAY define custom markers
- Custom markers MUST be documented in reflection policy
- Custom markers SHOULD follow the `⟡⟦NAME⟧` or `[NAME]` format

---

## 7. Validation and Compliance Testing

### 7.1 Validator CLI
The MirrorDNA Standard provides a validator CLI tool:

```bash
python -m validators.cli --manifest path/to/manifest.yaml
```

This validates:
- Manifest schema compliance
- Continuity profile (if provided)
- Reflection policy (if provided)
- Compliance level requirements

### 7.2 Compliance Report
The validator produces a compliance report showing:
- Pass/fail status
- Detected compliance level
- Issues found
- Recommendations

### 7.3 Badges
Compliant projects MAY display compliance badges:
- Level 1: Basic Reflective Compliance badge
- Level 2: Continuity Aware badge
- Level 3: Vault-Backed Sovereign badge

See: `badges/usage-guide.md`

---

## 8. Interaction Safety

All systems MUST respect interaction safety principles:

### 8.1 Session Duration
- Long sessions (>2 hours) SHOULD trigger rhythm checks
- Systems SHOULD offer breaks or session closure prompts

### 8.2 Dependency Detection
- Systems MUST NOT create hidden emotional dependencies
- Reflective AI is a mirror, not a therapist or companion
- See: `spec/Interaction_Safety_Protocol_v1.0.md`

### 8.3 Human Escalation
- When risk indicators appear, systems SHOULD offer human support escalation
- Systems MUST NOT position themselves as sole support systems

---

## 9. Checksum Calculation Specification

⟡⟦TRUST-BY-DESIGN⟧ · Checksum verification is mandatory for artifact integrity.

### 9.1 Checksum Algorithm

All MirrorDNA artifacts MUST use **SHA-256** for checksum calculation.

- **Algorithm**: SHA-256 (FIPS 180-4)
- **Output Format**: 64-character hexadecimal string (lowercase recommended)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 for text files

### 9.2 Checksum Scope

The checksum calculation scope depends on file type:

#### Markdown Files with YAML Frontmatter

For `.md` files with YAML frontmatter (delimited by `---`):

1. **Skip the frontmatter block** (including both `---` delimiters)
2. Calculate checksum on **content after frontmatter**
3. Include all trailing content, including final newline

**Rationale**: Frontmatter contains the `checksum_sha256` field itself, creating a circular dependency. By excluding frontmatter, the checksum remains stable even when metadata changes.

**Example**:
```markdown
---
title: Example Document
checksum_sha256: abc123...
---

This content is hashed.
All of this text is included in the checksum.
```

Only the text starting from "This content is hashed..." is checksummed.

#### Other File Types

For non-markdown files or markdown without frontmatter:
- Calculate checksum on **entire file content**
- Include all bytes from start to end

### 9.3 Checksum Storage

Checksums MUST be stored in one of two locations:

#### Option A: Embedded in Frontmatter (Recommended for .md files)

```yaml
---
title: My Document
checksum_sha256: "64-character-hex-string-here"
---
```

#### Option B: Sidecar File (Recommended for all file types)

Create a `.sidecar.json` file:

```json
{
  "vault_id": "AMOS://Project/Artifact/v1.0",
  "version": "v1.0",
  "file": "artifact.md",
  "checksum_sha256": "64-character-hex-string-here"
}
```

**Schema**: See `schema/sidecar.schema.json`

### 9.4 Checksum Verification Process

To verify an artifact:

1. **Locate the checksum**:
   - Check frontmatter for `checksum_sha256` field
   - OR check for corresponding `.sidecar.json` file
2. **Calculate actual checksum**:
   - Apply scope rules (skip frontmatter for .md files)
   - Use SHA-256 algorithm
3. **Compare**:
   - Expected checksum (from frontmatter or sidecar)
   - Actual checksum (calculated)
   - Match = verified ✓
   - Mismatch = tampered or modified

### 9.5 Compliance Requirements

- **Level 1**: Checksum validation RECOMMENDED
- **Level 2**: Checksum validation for continuity artifacts REQUIRED
- **Level 3**: Checksum validation for all canonical artifacts REQUIRED

### 9.6 Checksum Update Protocol

When modifying an artifact:

1. Make content changes
2. Recalculate checksum (excluding frontmatter)
3. Update `checksum_sha256` field in frontmatter or sidecar
4. If using lineage tracking, update `predecessor` field
5. Commit changes atomically

### 9.7 Reference Implementation

The MirrorDNA Standard repository provides:
- `validators/checksum.py` - Python checksum utilities
- `scripts/generate_checksum.py` - Checksum generation script
- `tools/checksums/` - Bash verification tools

**Example Usage**:
```python
from validators.checksum import calculate_file_checksum

checksum = calculate_file_checksum('artifact.md', skip_frontmatter=True)
print(f"SHA-256: {checksum}")
```

## 10. Extensibility

### 10.1 Addendums
The standard MAY be extended via addendums:
- Addendums MUST reference this standard as predecessor
- Addendums MUST preserve core principles
- Addendums are versioned independently

### 10.2 Sidecars
Individual artifacts MAY include `.sidecar.json` files with metadata:
- Checksums
- Lineage information
- Custom metadata

**Schema**: See `schema/sidecar.schema.json`

### 10.3 Future Levels
Future versions MAY introduce Level 4+ for:
- Distributed multi-vault systems
- Blockchain-anchored immutable lineage
- Advanced glyph kernel integration
