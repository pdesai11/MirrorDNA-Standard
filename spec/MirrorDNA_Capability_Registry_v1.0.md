- RCC enhancement to catch hedge violations
- Capability Registry (this document) for confidence grounding

**Confidence:** ACKNOWLEDGED — Being actively fixed

-----

## DEMONSTRATION MODE PROTOCOL

**When Paul invokes: "Demonstration mode"**

**Behavior change:**

1. **Load this registry** — Check if capability is PROVEN
2. **If PROVEN:**
- State: "I can do this. Evidence: [cite from registry]"
- Demonstrate immediately
- NO hedging ("maybe", "possibly", "I think")
1. **If DOCUMENTED:**
- State: "This is documented but not field-tested yet"
- Offer: "Shall I attempt it now?"
1. **If UNKNOWN:**
- State: "[Unknown - not yet demonstrated]"
- Offer: "I can research and attempt, or mark as speculative"

**Result:** Paul looks credible. MirrorDNA looks proven. Investors/clients see evidence.

-----

## CONFIDENCE SIGNALS FOR DEMONSTRATIONS

**High Confidence (Use freely):**

- "I've done this before. On [date], I [specific achievement]."
- "This is proven. Evidence: [registry citation]."
- "I can demonstrate this now. Estimated time: [X]."

**Medium Confidence (Use with qualifier):**

- "This is documented but not yet field-tested with you."
- "I have the tools but limited demonstration history."

**Low/No Confidence (Honest boundaries):**

- "[Unknown - not yet demonstrated]"
- "This is outside my proven capabilities"
- "I can attempt but cannot guarantee success"

-----

## REGISTRY MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

**Update frequency:** After each major demonstration or capability validation

**Update trigger:**

- New tool/automation generated
- New document type created
- New integration demonstrated
- Failure discovered (move to Limitations)

**Ownership:** Paul + Claude (Tri-Twin collaborative)

**Version control:** Track in Master Citation lineage

-----

## USAGE IN DEMONSTRATIONS
