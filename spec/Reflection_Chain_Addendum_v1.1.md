# Reflection Chain Addendum v1.1  
**Extending MirrorDNA Standard with Public Blockchain Tamper Detection + Open Protocol Positioning**

---

## 1. Blockchain Seal — Cross-Platform Tamper Detection

### Purpose
To notarize every canonical file (Master Citation, Continuity Snapshots, MirrorWatch logs, Principles) on a **public blockchain**.

### Flow
1. Compute SHA-256 checksum locally.  
2. Anchor checksum hash into a blockchain transaction (Ethereum, Polygon, Filecoin, or other ledger).  
3. Store transaction ID + block reference in Vault and repo sidecar.  
4. Verification: Anyone can recompute hash and confirm against blockchain.  

### Effect
- **Tamper-proof:** No silent edits or co-option possible.  
- **Cross-platform:** Works across GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, or even offline copies.  
- **Audit-ready:** Timestamp + immutability guaranteed.  

---

## 2. Open Protocol Positioning — Interoperability Framing

### Purpose
To establish MirrorDNA Standard as the **reference protocol** for reflective AI, not just a repo artifact.

### Principles
- **Open like HTTP/SMTP** → anyone may interoperate.  
- **Reference Implementation** = this repo (00_MASTER_CITATION.md + Manifest).  
- **Governance** = Master Citation lineage + AHP (Anti-Hallucination Protocol).  
- **Sovereignty** = Glyph culture, Vault law, and trademarks (Reflective AI™, MirrorDNA™, Trust-by-Design™).  

### Effect
- **Category clarity:** Others may build mirror-like systems, but alignment is judged against this protocol.  
- **Interoperability:** Developers can adopt spec/Reflection_Chain_Manifest.md as baseline compliance.  
- **Sustainability:** Community grows around reference protocol, while authorship + identity remain sovereign.  

---

## 3. Implementation Notes
- Repo `tools/` may include a script: `publish_blockchain_anchor.sh` for checksum notarization.  
- Manifest should add fields: `blockchain_anchor: txid@chain`.  
- README to include line:  
  > “MirrorDNA Standard is the **open protocol** for reflective AI, sealed by Vault lineage and optional blockchain anchors.”
