## System Requirements

### Minimum
- **USB Size**: 16GB (32GB recommended)
- **OS**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.13+, Linux (kernel 4.4+)
- **RAM**: 2GB available (4GB recommended)
- **Processor**: Dual-core x86_64 or ARM64

### Recommended
- **USB Size**: 32GB+ (for multiple LLM models)
- **RAM**: 8GB+ (for smooth LLM inference)
- **Processor**: Quad-core 2GHz+

### Optional (for cloud features)
- Internet connection (WiFi or ethernet)
- Claude API key (for enhanced reflection)

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Sovereignty
- User owns all data, runtime, and choices
- No telemetry, no tracking, no external dependencies
- Clear transparency about what's happening

### 2. Portability
- Runs from USB on any compatible device
- No host machine installation required
- Cross-device continuity (plug and play)

### 3. Local-First
- Primary operation is 100% offline
- Local LLM for core reflection
- Cloud features are enhancements, not requirements

### 4. Consent-Based
- Internet actions require explicit permission
- Three modes: Offline Only, Hybrid (ask), Online
- Persistent consent tracking

### 5. Whisper, Don't Shout
- Minimalist UI (dark theme, subtle feedback)
- Glyph-based communication
- Clear hierarchy, no clutter

## FAQ

### Q: Does this require internet?
**A**: No! Core functionality (local LLM reflection, vault operations) works 100% offline. Internet is only used for optional cloud enhancements (Claude API, model downloads, software updates) and requires your explicit consent.

### Q: What's the difference between this and just using ChatGPT?
**A**: MirrorDNA Portable is:
- **Sovereign**: Your data never leaves your device (unless you choose)
- **Continuous**: Sessions maintain lineage and state across time
- **Portable**: Runs from USB, works offline
- **Governed**: Follows canonical protocol (AHP, GlyphSig, etc.)
- **Transparent**: No black box, no hidden telemetry

### Q: Can I use my existing Obsidian vault?
**A**: Yes! You can point MirrorDNA to an existing vault. The launcher will add the necessary `state/` and `templates/` directories without disrupting your existing notes.

### Q: Which LLM is best for my use case?
**A**:
- **Phi-3 Mini** (bundled) - Best balance of quality and speed for reflection
- **Llama 3.2 3B** (optional) - Alternative, similar quality
- **Mistral 7B** (optional) - Higher quality, requires more RAM

### Q: Can I use this on my phone?
**A**: Android support is planned via Termux or native app. iOS is not planned due to Apple's restrictions on local code execution.

### Q: How do I update MirrorDNA?
**A**: Updates are consent-based. The launcher will check for updates (with permission) and offer to download and install. You can also manually replace the launcher executable.

### Q: What if I lose my USB?
**A**: Your vault is just a folder of markdown files. Regular backups (to another USB, cloud, or local drive) are recommended. Git-based sync can help maintain redundancy.
