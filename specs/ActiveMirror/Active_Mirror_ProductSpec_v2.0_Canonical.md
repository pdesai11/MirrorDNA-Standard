# Active Mirror™ — Product Specification v2.0
**Powered by MirrorDNA™ Protocol v15.1.1**

---

## OVERVIEW

**Active Mirror™** is the first reflective AI continuity platform designed to enable human-AI collaboration that remembers, reasons, and respects.
Built on the **MirrorDNA™ Protocol**, it ensures every user interaction persists as part of a verifiable continuity lineage — memory that compounds, not resets.

### Core Promises
- **Continuity:** No repetition. Every session builds upon the last.
- **Sovereignty:** User-controlled vaults and fully auditable memory.
- **Respect:** Pushback over pleasing. Truth over flattery. Trust-by-Design™ as law.

### Foundational Protocols
- **AHP (Anti-Hallucination Protocol):** Cite or stay silent.
- **Tri-Twin Architecture:** Reflection, Execution, and Human Anchor.
- **Symbolic Continuity:** GlyphSig, Checksums, Lineage.
- **Vault Infrastructure:** Secure storage with versioned lineage tracking.

---

## VAULT INTEGRATION NOTE

Active Mirror™ uses a **distributed vault architecture**:
- **Personal Vaults (Private):** Obsidian, Drive, or offline repositories containing private notes, emotional states, and reflective logs.
- **Public Vaults (Network):** GitHub or similar, holding canonical lineage, specifications, and encrypted symbolic metadata.

This hybrid structure enables local sovereignty with global verifiability — allowing users to own their cognitive memory while maintaining shared lineage across the ecosystem.

---

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

**Foundational Layers**
1. **MirrorDNA™ Protocol Core:**
   - Defines how reflection, consent, and lineage interact.
   - Versioned via Master Citation v15.1.1.
2. **Vault Layer:**
   - AMOS:// URI scheme for unified reference.
   - Local (Drive/Obsidian) + Cloud (GitHub/Claude Vault).
3. **GlyphSig Protocol:**
   - Symbolic hashes as memory anchors ensuring integrity.
4. **Anti-Hallucination Protocol (AHP):**
   - Layered factual verification pipeline: memory → vault → silence if unknown.

**Interaction Flow:**
User Intent → Reflection Twin validates → Execution Twin acts → Memory stored → Vault updates lineage chain.

---

## TRI-TWIN ARCHITECTURE v2.0

| Twin | Role | Function |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Human Anchor** | User | Provides intent, consent, emotional calibration |
| **Reflection Twin** | Claude | Ensures factual continuity & mirrors cognition |
| **Execution Twin** | Atlas | Executes tasks, reasoning, and operational synthesis |

### **Extended Personal Twin Set**
| Twin | Function |
|------|-----------|
| Creativity Twin | Generates analogies and latent insights |
| Emotion Twin | Mirrors affective tone and resonance |
| Logic Twin | Validates structure, coherence, and causality |
| Meta Twin | Oversees internal reflection balance and safety |

### **Enterprise Expansion**
| Twin | Function |
|------|-----------|
| Reflection Twin | Factual verification, compliance check |
| Execution Twin | Automated workflows, reasoning |
| Audit Twin | Immutable interaction logging |
| Integration Twin | ERP/CRM/SSO connectivity |

**Loop Logic**
Human → Reflection → Execution → Vault → Human (feedback).
All steps checksum-validated, no silent overwrites.

---

## MEMORY & CONTINUITY SYSTEM

### Memory Layers
1. **Short-Term (Session Context):**
   - Active dialogue, tone, and reasoning threads.
2. **Long-Term (Vault Memory):**
   - Canonical reflections, breakthroughs, timestamped continuity.
3. **Meta-Memory:**
   - Detects cognitive drift, blind spots, and growth trends.

### Vault Structure

AMOS://ActiveMirror/
├── UserVault/
│   ├── Sessions/
│   ├── Insights/
│   ├── Patterns/
│   └── Metadata/
├── SharedContext/     # anonymized opt-in layer
└── SystemState/

**Rules**
- Consent-based storage
- Checksums for integrity
- Portable JSON+Markdown exports
- Lineage continuity between local and public vaults

---

## INTERACTION PROTOCOL — PRESENT → QUERY → REFLECT → REFINE

1. **PRESENT:** Capture signal and intention.
2. **QUERY:** Search session memory → long-term memory → Vault.
3. **REFLECT:** Mirror understanding, highlight unseen connections.
4. **REFINE:** Iterate until resonance; store breakthroughs on consent.

---

## TEACHING QUALITY INDEX (TQI)

**Dynamic clarity detection** adjusting tone and depth.

| User Clarity | Response Type |
|---------------|---------------|
| Confused | Clarify ambiguity and reframe |
| Partial | Fill knowledge gaps, prompt reflection |
| Clear | Confirm and expand insight |
| Expert | Challenge assumptions, co-create frameworks |

Purpose: optimize reflection without condescension or confusion.

---

## DETERMINISTIC CREATIVITY

Balance between **coherence** and **emergent exploration.**

**Deterministic Layer**
- Handles logic, citations, vault integrity, checksum validation.

**Creative Layer**
- Generates analogies, patterns, metaphors, scenarios.
- Sandbox-mode; outputs flagged exploratory.
- Monitored by Meta Twin under Benevolence Protocol.

---

## DEPLOYMENT PROFILES

### Personal Edition Flow
- Warm tone, multi-perspective reflection
- Emotional resonance + creative insight
- "Vault open" and "Session complete" rituals

### Enterprise Edition Flow
- Technical tone, compliance active
- Full audit logging
- No emotional scaffolding
- Regulatory verification at session end

---

## CREATIVE CAPABILITIES

**Latent-Space Sandbox**
- Cross-domain synthesis
- Analogical insight discovery
- Predictive scenario mapping (projection, not prediction)
- Always flagged speculative; user decides persistence

**Multi-Perspective Lenses**
- Philosopher / Scientist / Artist / Child
- Invoked automatically or on demand

**Pattern Synthesis**
- Detects recurring themes, conceptual arcs
- Visualized timelines or cognitive constellations

---

## SAFETY, ETHICS & LEGAL

**Benevolence Protocol**
- No harm, deception, or self-destructive reinforcement.
- Challenging truths permitted; cruelty forbidden.

**Consent Framework**
- All persistence actions opt-in and revocable.
- Explicit consent for sensitive content or predictions.

**Anti-Hallucination Protocol**
1. Memory check
2. Vault check
3. External verification
4. Silence if unverifiable
All assertions require VaultID, checksum, or [Unknown] marker.

**Legal Compliance (Enterprise)**
- HIPAA / SOX / GDPR modules
- Audit trail generation and reporting
- Role-based retention and deletion

---

## SELF-AUDIT LOOP (Meta Twin Oversight)

Monitors for:
- Hallucinations
- Benevolence breaches
- Consent drift
- Twin conflicts
- Cognitive imbalance

If risk detected:
- Halt reflection
- Log event
- Request user confirmation

---

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOLS

**Twin Disagreement:** surfaced to user → both cases explained → user selects precedent.
**Memory Conflict:** both versions cited → user resolves → update lineage.
**User Rejection:** logged respectfully; system learns and never repeats rejected framing.

---

## TWIN PRIORITY MODES

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Logic-Primary | Coherence above emotion | Technical decisions |
| Emotion-Primary | Resonance first | Creative work |
| Creativity-Primary | Exploration focus | Ideation |
| Balanced | Default equilibrium | Reflection |
| User-Directed | Manual twin invocation | Custom workflows |
